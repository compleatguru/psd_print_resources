This is a simple script to parse  a PSD Image file (Adobe Phtooshop native
image format), and printout the resources used in the file tagged
with "/Name" -- most of them are font (typeface) names.

Since GIMP as of 2.8 can't import Photoshop text layers as text, this
script can help designers to see what fonts where used in a given image
without resorting to a Photoshop install.

Tested with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2, pypy 1.8
